2013:

working version: 1.1.2

July 11
QuickTone:
Sine array is now explicitly a ring array, designed to always be size power of two, using a bit mask instead of modulo
(In fact, the modulo seems to be optimized into the bit mask when I use a power of two, so it is mainly to be explicit)

Quicktone:
Increased size of sine array, arbitrarily, for no good reason. (Heard very slow beating while practicing; maybe that'll help.)

version 1.1.3
Now it has com.thefourthspecies in the project manifest instead of graham
